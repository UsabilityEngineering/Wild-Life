      <ul>
        <li>
          Many use cases of our app calls for using it quickly and efficiently, so we decided to go with a camera as a home screen to cut out any     unnecessary parts of the flow
        </li>
        <li>
          Keeping aligned with that design mentality, we wanted the interactions on this page limited and to the point, so we only offer options to view previous uploads, upload from a camera roll, and take a picture using the app
        </li>
        <li>
          A design decision which is less appearant because this is a wireframe is our descision to make login, <b>unnecessary</b> for app usage. This is because it takes time to create an account and also the persistance accross multiple phones and platforms isnt completely necessary

      <ul>
        <li>
          This page is one of the most vital when it comes to determining the if a plant is poisonous or not so users being confidence in the decision is key
        </li>
        <li>
          Again use cases have time being of great importance so a danger level is displayed to either to make users feel relieved, or prompt them to get help quickly
        </li>
        <li>
          In surveys users indicated that they need to confirm the plant's species themselves so the we give the user a "stock" image and let them compare it to their own side by side
        </li>
        <li>
          Another thing users indicated in the survey was a need to have a confidence level, and a way to see other possible matches so that is included in the design as a blue text link styled to look like many websites help text
        </li>
        <li>
          This page displays a lot of information, so we needed a way to have more than what a page could hold, thats where a bottom draggable sheet comes into play which in many cases will contain descriptions of plants that users don't necessarily need to see

        <ul>
        <li>
          This page shows more examples of the same plant that the user scanned, this is to help improve user confidence of their decision
        </li>
        <li>
          The images are expandable and appear in a 2 x X grid to be easily navigatable, because the user might want to scan through many options

          This page shows the other possible matches that the model produces, each labeled with percentage confidence values
        </li>
        <li>
          The cards also contain images of the plant and are clickable, bringing the user to another "possible match page" where they can get more comparison photos of the plant
