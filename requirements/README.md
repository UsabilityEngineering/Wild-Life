# Requirements Gathering

Methods:
1. Interviews(n=2) Questions we hope to answer: 
   - What would you like to see in this app to make it the most usable and helpful. 
   - What Priorities do you have when using this app.
   - How long would you wait for an answer to show up?
   - Why we chose this method: At this point quantitative data is hard to gather, and It would be good to understand the scope of what the user would use this for.
2. Questionnaires(n=10)
   - Questions we hope to answer: Parts of the flow that were confusing, what could be improved on, are you alive.
   - Why we chose this method: more insight to the user experience and its super easy and quick to grab a bunch of data.
3. Target questions:
   - Who wants to use our service?
   - How much effort would be involved with using it?
   - Would people trust our analysis of a poisonous plant?
   - Is there a sizable population that encounters poisonous plants on a daily basis?
   - Are people in these situations panicking?


Survey:
 - Demographics: The demographics of users I collected information from included college students from various majors including people in class, and family members.
 - Findings: 
    - Encounter poisonous plants - 80%  of survey respondents encountered poisonous plants regularly.
    - Internet access - 50% of respondents were not sure they had internet access.
    - Activities - Included outdoor activities such as hiking, foraging and camping.
    - Poisonous Resolution - Most respondents did not resolve whether a plant was poisonous using the internet, and were focused on poison ivy/oak.
    - Trust - 80% of respondents would trust an AI based plant recognition app and the other 20% stated that they would need to see it consistently work before
      trusting it, and other mentions of mistrust include: high risk situation, lack of knowledge in plant database, and others would need a picture to confirm           themselves.
Interview:
 - Demographics: ages ranged from 21-24
 - Findings:
    - Camera Menu: UI loading directly into a camera would be most understandable.
    - Picture Example: Bother interviewees wanted a picture to confirm the plant themselves.
    - Use cases: both interviewees explained how there werent many poisonous plants in places that people go most often revealing how niche of a use case this             service fits. We need to explore the types of users that would use this most frequently: foragers.



Conclusions 
 - Confirmation Picture because we found that users don't have complete trust in our system so they would like to confirm the plant themselves
 - Offline Functionality because we found that the scenarios where users would use this service most would be on hikes, which donâ€™t have internet all of the time.



Caveats - 
 - Mostly student survey takers, so we lack a representative sample of most other parts of the population. And most of our data being from students, we only get a      view of younger, generally more active people. This could mean that there is a large segment of the population that would not use this.
   Not enough survey takers: our sample size ended up being around 15, which does not give us enough to make any statistically sound assumptions based off of their    answers.
 - Open ended questions: Because of the need for detail about the scenarios people were in we had to use open ended questions, where people ended up giving us very    brief answers.
